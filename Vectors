/*Thus the program to get vector1 & vector2 from user in 2dimensions and perform sum of two vector as resultant vector,
Compute magnitude and angle of resultant vector is done and executed successfully.
Working of this program:
1)First we are declaring and getting 2 vectors a and b from user in 2D array
2)Next we are performing addition operation with the two vectors as resultant vectors
3)Then we are finding magnitude and angle of resultant vectors
4)Now we are printing all this by printf function*/
